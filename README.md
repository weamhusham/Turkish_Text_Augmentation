# **Augmenting Turkish Text Datasets with LLMs and Embedding Models**

## **Project Overview**

This project explores the impact of data augmentation and representation learning on machine learning models for text classification and sentiment analysis. By employing advanced embedding models and large language models (LLMs), we augment datasets and analyze the performance of various machine learning algorithms. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Test Augmentation**: Enhancing test data with augmented examples generated by LLMs.
2. **Training Augmentation**: Expanding training datasets to improve model performance.

Results and analysis can be found in the accompanying article.

## **Course and Instructor**

This project is part of the course **Kolektif Öğrenme 2024/1** at the Department of Computer Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, supervised by **Prof. Dr. Mehmet Fatih AMASYALI**.

### **Datasets**

1. **Turkish News Dataset**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anil1055/turkish-headlines-dataset)
   - A dataset containing Turkish news headlines categorized by their topics.
2. **Turkish Sentiment Analysis Dataset**: [Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maydogan/Turkish_SentimentAnalysis_TRSAv1)
   - A dataset for sentiment analysis of Turkish text, labeled for positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

### **Embedding Models**

1. **[JinaAI Jina-Embeddings-v3](https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3)**
   - A Hugging Face model used to generate dense vector embeddings for text.
2. **[Intfloat Multilingual E5-Large-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/e5-large)**
   - A multilingual embedding model designed for instruction-following tasks.
3. **[YTU-CE-Cosmos Turkish-ColBERT](https://huggingface.co/ytu-ce-cosmos/turkish-colbert)**
   - A Turkish-specific ColBERT embedding model optimized for efficient similarity search.

### **Large Language Models (LLMs) for Augmentation**

1. **[vngrs-ai/VBART-XLarge-Paraphrasing](https://huggingface.co/vngrs-ai/VBART-XLarge-Paraphrasing)**
   - Used for generating paraphrased text augmentations.
2. **[vngrs-ai/VBART-Large-Paraphrasing](https://huggingface.co/vngrs-ai/VBART-Large-Paraphrasing)**
   - A smaller version of VBART-XLarge optimized for paraphrasing.
3. **[ytu-ce-cosmos/turkish-gpt2-large-750m-instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/ytu-ce-cosmos/turkish-gpt2-large-750m-instruct-v0.1)**
   - A GPT-2-based Turkish model for instruction-based text generation.

   **Augmentation Strategy**:
   - **Test Augmentation**: Each test sample is augmented with 3 and 5 paraphrased examples.
   - **Training Augmentation**: Training datasets are expanded by 2x, 3x, and 5x to study performance improvements.
